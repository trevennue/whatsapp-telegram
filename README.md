# whatsapp-telegram
[machugram](https://www.github.com/machugram) came up with the idea of being able to send message on one platform and it atomatically getting copied to the other platform.

A very brilliant idea. I've decided to take up the challenge of developing means to make it possible. 

Checkout this repository. It has everything I'm using to achieve this. Thanks Machu!
